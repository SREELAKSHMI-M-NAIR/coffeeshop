                Caffeine alone won't help you slim down. It may slightly boost weight-loss efforts or help prevent
                weight gain, but there's no solid evidence that caffeine consumption leads to noticeable weight
                loss.

            <h3>
                Blood vessels tend to dilate before a headache. Caffeine has vasoconstrictive properties, meaning it
                narrows blood vessels, restricting blood flow. Since caffeine prevents the dilation of blood
                vessels, to prevent headaches.

                individuals. However, there is little research to prove that caffeine can help treat dry eyes.
